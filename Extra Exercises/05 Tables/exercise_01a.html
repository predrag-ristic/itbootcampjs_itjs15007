        <h1>Rome’s Top Tourist Attractions</h1>

        <tr>
            <p>More than 15.2 million tourists visited Rome in 2018, an increase of 1.1 million on the number of visitors in 2017. Here are some of the things that shouldn't be missed in the Italian capital.</p>
            <p>The Colosseum was built in 72 A.D. and hosted many gladiator fights. Some say that it was also filled with water for ship battles, but experts don’t know if it definitely was. As many as 6 million tourists now visit the Colosseum every year.</p>
            <p>The Pantheon was built as a Roman temple, but has been a Christian church since 609 A.D. and has become an important tourist attraction. It's a great example of a building from ancient Rome because even after almost 2,000 years it's not been as badly damaged as other famous Roman buildings.</p>
            <p>The Vatican city is located in Rome, but it is really the world’s smallest country and the center of the Roman Catholic church. It has 11 museums and one of the world’s largest private art collections. It is also home to the Sistine chapel, where artist Michelangelo painted its famous ceiling.</p>
            <p>Anyone visiting Rome must try the local food. Pasta meals made with lots of cheese like carbonara or cacio e pepe are popular with both Italians and tourists. Suppli are rice balls that can have cheese, meat and tomato in them. For something sweet, try maritozzo, a bread served with cream that is often enjoyed with coffee.</p>
